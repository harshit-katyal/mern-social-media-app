## Important changes inside signup page.

- I've removed all the states for username input field on signup page.

- Now, we're using vanilla js alongwith useRef hooks inside signup page for making updates to username field. The changes made are inside pages/signup.js

## axios cancelToken deprecated

- Starting from v0.22.0 Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests and cancelToken method is deprecated.

- I've replaced cancelToken with AbortController inside the project. Changes made are inside pages/signup.js and components/Layout/Search.js

## components/HeadTags.js removed

- With the latest version (12.1.0), nextjs recommends to link stylesheets inside pages/\_document.js. And the tags like `<title>, <meta>` to be moved inside next/head.

- Thats why the stylesheets link tags have been moved to pages/\_document.js. And the meta tags are inside pages/\_app.js.

- Visit [NextJs Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-stylesheets-in-head-component) for more info.

## moment.js replaced with dayjs

- The main reason behind this is that moment.js is in maintenance mode. Also, moment is a huge library.

- Comparatively, dayjs is only 2kb in size. The changes made are inside utils/calculateTime.js

## Some other minor bug fixes..

<br />
Note: The vulnerabilities warning which appears while installing node_modules is because of nodemailer-sendgrid-transport dependency. You can remove this dependency if you aren't going to use it for emails.
